            <p>I grew up in the village of Mahasenpura in Welikanda, a village beyond Polonnaruwa. 
                As a child I was educated at Mahasenpura Primary School. 
                Then I went to Aselapura Maha Vidyalaya to do O / L. 
                After that I entered Welikanda Central College for A / L education. 
                During this educational journey, my education focused on various industrial innovations. 
                I wanted to go to a university for further education. 
                My marks were not enough to go to government universities. 
                I decide to sign up for esoft metro campus.
                 There I was studying for an honors degree in Information Technology.</p></div>
